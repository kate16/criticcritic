NETS213 Final Project - Fall 2014

Overview:
Basically we're collecting data on the way politicians from different backgrounds are described in the media. So our first step is to gather articles about politicians, then we use crowdworkers to find the adjectives in the articles that describe the politicians. To aggregate the data we input it into a word cloud generator for a good way to visualize the results.

Quality Control Model
Input - CSV file of URLs of articles about politicians
Processing - Multiple crowdworkers per article 
Output - CSV file of adjectives describing politicians

Aggregation Model
Input - CSV file of adjectives
Processing - Remove duplicates, check validity, and count the most common words
Output - Word cloud of most frequent adjectives used

Miscellaneous:
Data flowchart - called flowchart.pdf
Raw URL collection - a sample of the raw data called rawdata.csv
